### A variant of CALVIN model designed to specific region of the California Water network 

This folder includes two variants of the `CALVIN`:  (a) revin.py pertaining to cookie cut of the water network and (b) regvin.py desined for a specific region of the California water Network

There are two python scripts: postREVIN and combineData, which are common two both variants of the CALVIN. While former converts the CALVIN output to the time series format, latter one merges all the output in a single file.

In addition, main-annual-region.py is the script to run limited foresight of regional model and main-annual-cookie.py allows us to run cookie cut.
